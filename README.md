# Inttelligent Video Surveillance System using YOLO and OpenCV

This is a project to perform object detection, fall detection, car crash detection and social distancing detection.

# Software Required
Python(v3.9): Language in which code is written
CMake(v3.25.2): For compiling openCV
Visual Studio Code: For building openCV and darknet code
Nvidia GPU Driver: For faster GPU performance
CUDA(v12.0): For parallel computing using GPU
CuDNN(8.8.0): A GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks
OpenCV(v4.7.0): For working on images/videos in python
Darknet: Neural network framework for YOLO

# Deployment
We have deployed our project using Flask framework. Our website is hosted onto a local server and we can use that website to perform detections
on videos using Youtube video as input.
